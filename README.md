# JMetal-Plugin

Extends the [MOEA Framework](http://github.com/MOEAFramework/MOEAFramework) with a number of optimization algorithms implemented in JMetal.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`.  The version of this plugin matches the JMetal version number.

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.moeaframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>jmetal-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>5.11</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

With this plugin, you can reference any of the supported JMetal algorithms.

```java

NondominatedPopulation result = new Executor()
		.withProblem("DTLZ2_3")
		.withAlgorithm("AbYSS")
		.withMaxEvaluations(10000)
		.run();
```

## Limitations

Some functionality may not be available for JMetal algorithms.  This includes the ability to instrument algorithms
to collect runtime data.  JMetal algorithms only generate the end-of-run Pareto approximation set.
