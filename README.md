# JMetal-Plugin

Extends the [MOEA Framework](http://github.com/MOEAFramework/MOEAFramework) with optimization algorithms implemented in JMetal.
If using any of the JMetal algorithms, please cite:

Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 1093â€“1100. https://doi.org/10.1145/2739482.2768462

## Installation

When using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.moeaframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>jmetal-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>6.6.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Otherwise, download and add the `.jar` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/MOEAFramework/JMetal-Plugin/releases) page
to the classpath, which is typically the `MOEAFramework/lib/` folder.  Note we also publish a `-jar-with-dependencies`
version that includes the appropriate version of JMetal.

## Supported Versions

We aim to support the latest version of JMetal, however, there may be some delay after a new release.  The `{major}.{minor}` version
number of this project will match the supported JMetal version.  Below is a complete list of supported versions:

JMetal Version | JMetal-Plugin Latest | Supported MOEA Framework Versions | Supported Java Versions
-------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- | -----------------------
**`6.6`**      | **`>= 6.6.0`**       | **`>= 4.3`**                      | **`>= 19`**
`6.2`         | `6.2.3`             | `>= 4.0`                         | `>= 17`
`6.2`         | `6.2.0`             | `3.6 - 3.11`                    | `>= 14`
`6.1`         | `6.1.0`             | `3.6 - 3.11`                    | `>= 14`
`6.0`         | `6.0.1`             | `3.5 - 3.11`                    | `>= 14`
`5.11`        | `5.11.2`            | `3.2 - 3.11`                    | `>= 14`

## Usage

Once this plugin is added as a Maven dependency, you can reference JMetal algorithms as you would any other:

```java

NondominatedPopulation result = new Executor()
		.withProblem("DTLZ2_3")
		.withAlgorithm("AbYSS")
		.withMaxEvaluations(10000)
		.run();
```

JMetal algorithms are configured by supplying properties to the `Executor`.  We do not provide
a listing or explanation of these properties, but an easy way to figure out what properties are available
is to run:

```java

TypedProperties properties = new TypedProperties();	
new JMetalAlgorithms().getAlgorithm("ESPEA", properties, new DTLZ2(2));
System.out.println(String.join(", ", properties.getAccessedProperties()));
```

which displays:

```
maxEvaluations, pm.distributionIndex, pm.rate, populationSize, replacementStrategy, sbx.distributionIndex, sbx.rate
```

## Limitations

Some functionality may not be available for JMetal algorithms.  This includes the ability to instrument algorithms
to collect runtime data.  JMetal algorithms only generate the end-of-run Pareto approximation set.

Some algorithms are implemented in both JMetal and the MOEA Framework.  If such cases, you can request the JMetal
version by appending `-JMetal` to the name, such as `NSGAII-JMetal`.
